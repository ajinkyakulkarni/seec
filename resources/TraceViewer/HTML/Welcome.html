  <p>Welcome to the <b>SeeC</b> Trace Viewer.</p>

  <p>SeeC allows you to record the execution of programs that have been written in the C programming language. We call the record of your program's execution a <emph>trace</emph>. You can open and view these traces using this trace viewer. It will allow you to move forwards and backwards through the recorded execution of your program.</p>

  </p>SeeC may have detected runtime errors during your program's execution. These will also be displayed by this trace viewer.</p>
